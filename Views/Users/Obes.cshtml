            <div class="faq-question">How to prevent/deal with Obesity?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>
                    Preventing obesity involves adopting a healthy lifestyle and making sustainable changes to promote weight management. Here are some key strategies to help prevent obesity:
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    1. Balanced and Nutritious Diet: Focus on consuming a balanced diet that includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Limit the intake of processed foods, sugary drinks, and high-fat foods. Pay attention to portion sizes and practice mindful eating.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    2. Regular Physical Activity: Engage in regular physical activity to burn calories and maintain a healthy weight. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week, along with strength training exercises for muscle strengthening.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    3. Get Sufficient Sleep: Establish regular sleep patterns and aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night. Inadequate sleep can disrupt hormones that regulate hunger and appetite, leading to weight gain.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    4. Manage Stress: Find healthy ways to manage stress, as it can contribute to emotional eating and unhealthy food choices. Engage in activities like exercise, meditation, yoga, or hobbies to reduce stress levels.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    5. Monitor Weight Regularly: Keep track of your weight and body measurements periodically to identify any changes or trends. Regular monitoring can help you take timely action and make necessary adjustments to your lifestyle..

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Intermittent fasting involves cycling between periods of eating and fasting. The most common approach is the 16/8 method, where individuals fast for 16 hours and limit their eating to an 8-hour window each day. Other variations include alternate-day fasting or fasting for a full day or two per week. Intermittent fasting may help with calorie restriction and weight loss, but it may not be suitable for everyone, particularly those with certain medical conditions..</p><br />

                                                        1. In a bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, olive oil, minced garlic, dried rosemary, dried thyme, salt, and pepper.<br />
                                                        2. Place the chicken breasts in a shallow dish and pour the marinade over them, making sure they are evenly coated. Let the chicken marinate for at least 30 minutes, or up to overnight in the refrigerator.<br />
                                                        3. Preheat your grill to medium-high heat.<br />
                                                        4. Remove the chicken from the marinade and discard the excess marinade.<br />
                                                        5. Grill the chicken breasts for about 6-8 minutes per side, or until cooked through and no longer pink in the center. The cooking time may vary depending on the thickness of the chicken breasts. Remove from the grill and let them rest for a few minutes.<br />
                                                        6. While the chicken is resting, preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).<br />
                                                        7. In a baking sheet, toss the mixed vegetables with coconut oil or ghee, salt, and pepper.<br />
                                                        8. Roast the vegetables in the preheated oven for about 15-20 minutes, or until they are tender and slightly caramelized.<br />
                                                        9. Slice the grilled chicken breasts and serve them alongside the roasted vegetables.<br />
                                                        10. Garnish with fresh parsley if desired.<br />

                                                        6. While the asparagus is roasting, prepare the cauliflower rice. Cut the cauliflower into florets and place them in a food processor. Pulse until the cauliflower resembles rice-like grains.<br />
                                                        7. Heat coconut oil or ghee in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the cauliflower rice and sauté for about 5-7 minutes until it's tender. Season with salt and pepper to taste.<br />

                                                        7. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 5 minutes to lightly brown the tops.<br />

                                                        8. Remove from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes.<br />

                                                        3. In a small bowl, combine the olive oil, garlic powder, dried dill, salt, and pepper. Mix well.<br />
